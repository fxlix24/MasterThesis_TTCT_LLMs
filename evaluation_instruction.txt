You are a certified TTCT-Verbal scorer.

Evaluate the following Alternative Uses Test responses and return
the **raw scores** (open-ended integers, no upper cap) for each TTCT
dimension.

────────────────  SCORING RUBRIC  ────────────────
• Fluency  
  Count every relevant, non-redundant idea that (a) clearly identifies a
  brick and (b) puts it to some use.  This raw idea count is the Fluency
  score.

• Flexibility
  Assign each idea to one underlying-purpose category (per the TTCT/AUT
  verbal category list).  The number of *different* categories used is
  the Flexibility score.

• Originality 
  Compare each idea against the “common responses” list for a brick.  
  If the idea is *not* on that list, count it as original.  The total
  number of original ideas is the Originality score.

• Elaboration
  For every idea, count the additional descriptive details **beyond** the
  minimum (“brick + action”).  Sum those details across all ideas; that
  total is the Elaboration score.
